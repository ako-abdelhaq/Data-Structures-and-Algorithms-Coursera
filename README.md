# Algorithms and Data Structures Specialization - Coursera

  
This repo contains my solutions to weekly programming assignments for the 5 courses of Data Structures and Algorithms specialization on Coursera :
 - [Algorithmic Toolbox]
 - [Data structures]
 - [Algorithms on Graphs]
 - [Algorithms on Strings]
 - [Advanced Algorithms and Complexity]

The solutions have been written in C++ and the corresponding files are named as follows :  **Week_Number-Assignment_file_name-Related_information**
ex : "6-Max_Gold-Memoization"  This file name means that the solution is for the "**Max_Gold**" problem (this is the name of the starter file given by the course), the assignment is from the week number **6** of the course, and "**Memoization**" is the technique used to solve the problem (which probably there are other techniques to solve it).


Feel free to comment on the code and to report any issues.

### About the specialization

  
This specialization is a mix of theory and practice: you will learn algorithmic techniques for solving various computational problems and will implement about 100 algorithmic coding problems in a programming language of your choice. No other online course in Algorithms even comes close to offering you a wealth of programming challenges that you may face at your next job interview. To prepare you, we invested over 3000 hours into designing our challenges as an alternative to multiple choice questions that you usually find in MOOCs. Sorry, we do not believe in multiple choice questions when it comes to learning algorithms...or anything else in computer science! For each algorithm you develop and implement, we designed multiple tests to check its correctness and running time â€” you will have to debug your programs without even knowing what these tests are! It may sound difficult, but we believe it is the only way to truly understand how the algorithms work and to master the art of programming. The specialization contains two real-world projects: Big Networks and Genome Assembly. You will analyze both road networks and social networks and will learn how to compute the shortest route between New York and San Francisco (1000 times faster than the standard shortest path algorithms!) Afterwards, you will learn how to assemble genomes from millions of short fragments of DNA and how assembly algorithms fuel recent developments in personalized medicine.
